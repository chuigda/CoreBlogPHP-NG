_Compiler engineer_

- Implemented normalisation of Julia IR (intermediate representation) used by Julia static compiler.
- Designed and implemented parser of MATLAB(R) language for our own MATLAB(R) implementation, supporting many dubious syntaxes of MATLAB(R) language and of its dialects. The new parser outperforms the previous ANTLR-based one by 50 times.
- Implemented a networking library for Julia, providing HTTP sever/client and WebSocket server/client. Replacing HTTP.jl and other previous workarounds.
- Implemented a web-based user-interface for wrapping Julia functions to MATLAB(R) functions.
- Implemented VSCode workspace and debugger for our own MATLAB(R) implementation.

*Qingdao Eastsoft Co.,Ltd*, Qingdao, China #h(1fr) 2021.4 - 2022.7

_Fullstack engineer_

- Participated in the development of a cloud platform for power IoT, which uses SpringBoot + MySQL + MongoDB + JPA/MyBatis for backend and Vue2 + iView + eCharts for frontend
- Developed a PDF report generator service based on Express.js + node-canvas + eCharts + LaTeX, where images are generated using node-canvas + eCharts

*Shanghai Tianxin Technology Co.,Ltd*, Shanghai, China #h(1fr) 2020.6 - 2021.3

_Fullstack engineer_

- Designed and implemented a protocol for uploading videos and audios from low-bandwidth embedded devices to the cloud.
- Implemented an audio and video encoder based on FFmpeg, which encodes the audio and video files uploaded by IoT devices into formats that can be played directly by mainstream browsers and video players (MP4 container + H264 video stream + YUV420P frame + AAC audio).
- Implemented the connection between the encoding server and the Node.js business server through RPC over HTTP.
- Helped solving several problems with the OV5640 camera on IoT devices.
- Implemented a utility for testing WebRTC servers, which uses the same technology as the selected alternative for WebRTC clients.

*Sourcebrella Inc.*, Shenzhen, China #h(1fr) 2018.7 - 2018.9

_Compiler engineer_

- Investigated bugs of clang-3.6, fixed them by writing patches and porting patches from higher versions of clang. Made eosio, Firefox, Android and some other projects compile with clang-3.6.
- Introduced a WebAssembly backend (skeleton only) to llvm-3.6, making it capable of generating LLVM IR targeting WebAssembly.
