# Wouldn't it be loverly

<div style="text-align: center">
All I want is a room somewhere <br/>
Far away from the cold night air <br/>
With one enormous chair <br/>
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly? <br/>

<br/>

Lots of chocolate for me to eat <br/>
Lots of coal makin' lots of heat <br/>
Warm face, warm hands, warm feet <br/>
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly? <br/>

<br/>

Oh, so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still <br/>
I would never budge 'til spring <br/>
Crept over me windowsill <br/>

<br/>

Someone's head restin' on my knee <br/>
Warm and tender as he can be <br/>
Who takes good care of me <br/>
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly? <br/>

<br/>

Loverly, loverly~ <br/>
loverly, loverly.
